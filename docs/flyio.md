# Fly.io

`Dotenvy` can be used when deploying an app to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). Folloing the instructions on the [Phoenix](docs/phoenix.md) page will get you most of the way there, but you also need to modify the `Dockerfile` so it copies over your `envs/` directory so your `.env` files are available to the `release` command.

## Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` gets generated when you setup your app (it is ultimately generated from `mix phx.gen.release --docker`). The `Dockerfile` is ultimately what is responsible for running `mix release`, so you need to ensure that all of your files and folders are copied into the container so this command can run.

In the examples provided in this documentation, `.env` files are stored in a directory named `envs/`.  If that's the directory housing your `.env` files, then you will need to make sure that that folder gets copied into the Docker container so it can properly build the release.  To do this, you will need to add a line `COPY envs envs` _before_ the `Run mix release` command.

```docker
# ... existing Docker stuf...

# Compile the release
RUN mix compile

# Changes to config/runtime.exs don't require recompiling the code
COPY config/runtime.exs config/

COPY rel rel

# <---- make the directory of envs available to the release!!!
COPY envs envs

RUN mix release

# ... existing Docker stuff cont'd...
```

Once that line is there, then running `fly deploy` and other `flyctl` commands should be able to build the release and include the `.env` files as expected.

## Environment Variables

Fly.io sets a handful of environment variables when it deploys an app (which you can inspect by running `System.get_env()` from an `iex` shell).  The following are the most significant that are used in the config files generated by the [Dotenvy Generators](https://hexdocs.pm/dotenvy_generators/):

- `RELEASE_ROOT`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `PHX_HOST`
- `PORT`
- `PHX_SERVER`
- `DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY`
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`

See the [Phoenix](docs/phoenix.md) page for getting a Phoenix app to run using `Dotenvy`.
