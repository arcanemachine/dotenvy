# Dotenv File Format

`.env` files (a.k.a. "dotenv") store key-value pairs in a format descended from
simple bash files that exported environment variables.

This implementation cleaves closely to the format described by the original [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) package, but it is not a direct match (by design).

Typically, a dotenv (`.env`) file is formatted into simple key-value pairs:

    S3_BUCKET=YOURS3BUCKET
    SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE

Optionally, you may add `export` in front of each line so you can `source` the file in Bash:

    export S3_BUCKET=YOURS3BUCKET
    export SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE

## Variable Names

For the sake of portability (and sanity), environment variable names must consist solely of letters, digits, and the underscore ( `_` ) and must not begin with a digit. In regex-speak, the names must match the following pattern:

    [a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*

### Example variable names

    DATABASE_URL  # ok  
    foobar        # ok  
    NO-WORK       # <-- invalid !!!
    ÃœBER          # <-- invalid !!!
    2MUCH         # <-- invalid !!!

## Values

Values are to the right of the equals sign. They may be quoted. Using single quotes will prevent variables from being interpolated and any command substitution will not be executed.

    SIMPLE=xyz123
    INTERPOLATED="Multiple\nLines and variable substitution: ${SIMPLE}"
    NON_INTERPOLATED='raw text without variable interpolation'
    MULTILINE = """
    long text here,
    e.g. a private SSH key
    """

## Escape Sequences

The following character strings will be interpreted (i.e. escaped) as specific codepoints in the same way you would expect if the values were assigned inside a script. Remember: when a text file is read, it is read as a series of utf8 encoded code points. Character sequences like `\n` have no special meaning until they are "escaped" and a combination of codepoints is replaced by a single codepoint.

- `\n` Linefeed (aka newline); `<<92, 110>>` -> `<<10>>`
- `\r` Carriage return; `<<92, 114>>` -> `<<13>>`
- `\t` Tab; -> `<<92, 116>>` -> `<<9>>`
- `\f` Form feed; -> `<<92, 102>>` -> `<<12>>`
- `\b` Backspace; -> `<<92, 98>>` -> `<<8>>`
- `\"` Double-quote; ->  `<<92, 34>>` -> `<<34>>`
- `\'` Single-quote; -> `<<92, 39>>` -> `<<39>>`
- `\\` Backslash; -> `<<92, 92>>` -> `<<92>>`
- `\uFFFF` Unicode escape (4 hex characters to denote the codepoint)

If a backslash precedes any other character, the backslash will be ignored and removed from output.

### Interpolation (a.k.a. Variable Substitution)

Values left unquoted or wrapped in double-quotes will interpolate variables in the `${VAR}` syntax. This can be useful for referencing existing system environment variables or to reference variables previously parsed.

For example:

    USER=admin
    EMAIL=${USER}@example.org
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://${USER}@localhost/my_database"
    CACHE_DIR=${PWD}/cache

Multi-line values (e.g. private keys) can use the triple-quoted heredoc syntax:

    PRIVATE_KEY="""
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    HkVN9...
    ...
    -----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    """

### Non-Interpolated

If your values must retain `${}` in their output, wrap the value in single quotes, e.g.:

    PASSWORD='!@G0${k}k'
    MESSAGE_TEMPLATE='''
        Hello ${PERSON},

        Nice to meet you!
    '''

## Comments

The hash-tag `#` symbol denotes a comment when on its own line or when it follows a quoted value.  It is not treated as a comment when it appears within quotes.

    # This is a comment
    SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # also a comment
    SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-hash-#-this-is-not-a-comment"

## Command Substitution

You need to add the output of a shell command in one of your variables? Simply add it with `$(your_command)` (available since version 1.0.0). This is helpful when tying into 3rd party password managers, e.g. [1Password](docs/guides/1password.md).

    API_KEY=$(op read op://MyVault/SomeService/api_key)

As with interpolated variables, the `$()` syntax only triggers the execution of a shell command when it appears _within double-quotes or in a line without quotes_. If you quote your value with single quotes, the values will remain as-is.

If you need more control over how (or if) commands within the `$()` syntax are executed, the `Dotenvy.Parser.parse/3` function supports 2 options: `:sys_cmd_fn` and `:sys_cmd_opts`. You can leverage these to do things such as perform linting of the `.env` files or disable system commands altogether.
